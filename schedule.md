# Tentative Lecture Schedule
{:.no_toc}

- This schedule might change slightly during the quarter. The dates of the exam, however, will not change.
- Slides will be uploaded to the course [home page](index.md), typically before each lecture. The lectures themselves might deviate significantly from the textbooks. Thus, it is necessary to attend a lecture live or view its video asynchronously to keep up with course content. 
- The industry guest lectures are not included in the syllabus for the exams. But they will be the focus of the extra credit activities. 
- Some topics may take a few weeks to cover.
