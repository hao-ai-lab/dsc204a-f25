# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the required knowledge for this course?**

**A:** This course assumes prerequisite knowledge as in the DSC 202 (Data Management for Data Science)

<!-- 
**Q: I don't know much about computer systems. Is that okay?**

**A:** The intended audience for the course are data scientists, and not systems engineers! It is completely fine to not have a background in computer systems. The course material will quickly brush up on computer systems fundamentals and then dive into different aspects of data systems and scalable data processing. The assignments will test your ability to _apply_ scalable data programming principles as a _data scientist_, and not on the internals of, say, MapReduce or task scheduling. 

**Q: This is my first time being a scribe. I'm not too sure what my role is.**

**A:**  First off, we're glad that you're taking some time to understand our expectations! The expectations from a scribe are simple: the scribe should faithfully capture the professor's explanations in the lecture. We expect the notes to have the same structure/main sections as the slides, and many similar wordings as well. Additionally, the notes should also have helpful examples given by the professor in the class, additional context for different topics when needed, etc. The TAs will assess your notes based on the contents in the slides.  

You should not, however, try to rearrange the content as you see fit, or add in material from the additional readings provided. The scribe notes do not have to be a self-contained document on the topic - we're only looking for you to capture what was taught in class.

**Q: What is the best way to get help in this course?**

**A:** Your best avenues are to go to office hours held by the course staff, or to ask questions on Ed. Course staff will be monitoring Ed frequently and will try to answer your question quickly and thoroughly.

**Q: Where will our grades for assignments be displayed for the course?**

**A:** Grades will be displayed on Gradescope for the written and autograded portions for all assignments (homeworks, labs, projects, and exams). For homeworks and projects, your total grade is the sum of the autograded portion and the written portion.

**Q: I passed all the tests when doing my homework/project, but still got points off on the autograded portion of the assignment. Why is this happening?**

**A:** The homeworks and projects have hidden tests that are not visible to students while they do the assignment. In order to pass these hidden tests, you must test your code yourself and make sure your answer is correct. Our tests are not always comprehensive.

**Q: I have a 0 on Gradescope for a lab that I attended and got checked off. Why is this?**

**A:** You likely did not submit the lab. If it is before the regrade deadline, submit the lab, and let your lab GSI know.

**Q: I worked with a partner on a project, and they have a grade on Gradescope for the project while I do not. Why is this happening?**

**A:** This is normal. Only one partner should have a grade on Gradescope, but the score will be applied to both partners.

**Q: I noticed a mistake in the grading of the written portion of my homework. How can I get this fixed?**

**A:** To get this fixed, you must submit a regrade request via Gradescope before the regrade deadline. This is known as the regrade request window. We unfortunately will not accept any regrades after the window has closed. All regrade deadline dates are posted on the same Ed post that releases the assignment grades and solutions.

**Q: I have some other grading questions. Who should I contact?**

**A:** Please contact your lab GSI. -->
